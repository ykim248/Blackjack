Project Description

    This was an idea i had for my final project during windows that i never got to finish.
    I want to create a client and server applications to play a game of blackjack using C#.
    Let's see how this goes.

Project Progress

    Created a Card class that represents a playing card with properties for the suit and rank,
    as well as an image file location. Implemented a Deck class that uses a list of Card objects
    to represent a standard deck of 52 playing cards. The class includes methods for shuffling 
    and drawing cards from the deck. Developed a Hand class that keeps track of a list of Card 
    objects representing the cards in a player's hand, as well as the total value of the hand. 
    The class includes methods for adding and removing cards, and calculating the value of the hand.

All of these classes are stored in the Blackjack.Models namespace.
